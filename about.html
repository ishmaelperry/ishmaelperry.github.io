   		<p>My name is Ishmael King'ori Perry. I was originally born in Castro Valley, but have moved all over the Bay and now live in San Lorenzo. I am in 10th Grade and attend San Lorenzo High School. I love to play basketball, I love to learn new things and to maintain a high GPA during the school year, also I am interested in Computer Science. The reason I am making this website is because I am in a program called SMASH. We take Stem classes during Summer, so we can keep our brains ready for school and not idle. This program has made coding an amazing experience for me and I want to keep pursuing CS.I hope people find this website helpful.<p/>
